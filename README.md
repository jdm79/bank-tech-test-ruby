# Bank Tech Test - Ruby


## Requirements

You should be able to interact with your code via a REPL like IRB or the JavaScript console. (You don't need to implement a command line interface that takes input from STDIN.)
Deposits, withdrawal.
Account statement (date, amount, balance) printing.
Data can be kept in memory (it doesn't need to be stored to a database or anything).


## Acceptance criteria

Given a client makes a deposit of 1000 on 10-01-2012
And a deposit of 2000 on 13-01-2012
And a withdrawal of 500 on 14-01-2012
When she prints her bank statement
Then she would see

```
date || credit || debit || balance
14/01/2012 || || 500.00 || 2500.00
13/01/2012 || 2000.00 || || 3000.00
10/01/2012 || 1000.00 || || 1000.00
```


## Design and Coding Process

Describe how you approached designing your solution to the problem.

Describe how you structured your code. Why did you do it this way?

Describe the dependencies your code has. What trade-offs did you make when deciding what dependencies to use?

Include screenshots of your running app.


## Extension

Try very hard to complete all the tasks in the tech test. If you run out of time, outline how you would have approached the sections you didn't get to.

Describe the extensions you would add if you had more time.


## How to run the program

Describe how to install and run your code and tests.
